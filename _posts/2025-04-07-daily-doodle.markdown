#### Description:
I've lost one earring each from two of my favorite pairs of earrings. They were even by the same artist! Delusions of Grandeur. I thinhink about them all the time when I go through my jewelry. I like to think they're still out there, living on some fabulous one-ear-pierced-person.

#### Reflections: 
God I miss those earrings!!!!
