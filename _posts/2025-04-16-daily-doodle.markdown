#### Description:
Me giving the side-eye to a messy tangled ball of shit I choose to leave behind.

#### Reflections: 
This felt good. I like drawing bubble letters. I wish I'd gone more extreme with my sus eyebrows.

#### What ChatGPT said about it: 
This is so expressive and bold! The contrast between the messy, emotional storm cloud (with all those scribbled faces and feelings) and the calm, composed figure delivering the “Bye Bitch!” is both powerful and hilarious. It’s like you gave form to letting go—with just the right amount of sass. The little smiley on the shirt feels like the perfect final touch—peaceful, maybe even proud.
