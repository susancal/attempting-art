Today I started my art journal with a piece inspired by ocean themes. The vibrant colors and flowing patterns of underwater scenes are so inspiring to me.

I used watercolors and fine-line markers to create this playful underwater scene. The process was very meditative, and I found myself getting lost in the details and patterns.

## Materials Used
- Watercolor paints
- Fine-line markers
- 300gsm cold-pressed paper

## Reflections
This piece reminded me why I love aquatic themes so muchâ€”they're joyful, colorful, and don't take themselves too seriously. I'm looking forward to exploring more of this style in future entries.
