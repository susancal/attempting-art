### Making Frames!

I had some prints from artists [Colete Martin](https://coletemartin.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Chris Plichta](https://fresh-alive-fine-art.square.site/){:target="_blank"} I wanted to frame. I got some $5 frames from TJ Maxx, broke out my mat cutter, and measured some scraps of navy and lavendar matboard. Guests using my downstairs bathroom will now be treated to the creepy gaze of my urinicorn.
