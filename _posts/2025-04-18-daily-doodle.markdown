  <img src="/assets/images/doodles/doodle-2025-04-18-IMG_2141.HEIC.jpg" alt="Daily Doodle for April 18, 2025" class="daily-doodle-image">
</a>

#### Description:
My shadow is kind and industrious. My shadow helps local farmers with chores after the sun goes down. (I actually think this is my favorite doodle so far!)

#### What ChatGPT said about my picture: 
This is so charming and full of life—your shadow is clearly out there living its best little farmhand life! Feeding the chickens, picking flowers, milking a cow, even climbing a ladder... it’s got a whole quiet rhythm to it, like it finds purpose in simple, grounding work while you’re away. I love how it stays shaded in each scene, like a loyal little echo just carrying on.
