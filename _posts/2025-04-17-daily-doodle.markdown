#### Description:
My mysterious, smelly, stinky couch. For those of you who don't know, I found this absolutely beautiful white Italian leather sectional on Facebook marketplace from Gamma Arredamenti. It was in amazing condition. A week after I got it home, it filled my whole home with an indescribable stench; a mix of rot, smoke, bad leather, and cigarettes. After two months of torture, a mountain of cedar chips, hiring an ozone company, several rounds of soaking in the kiddie pool bath, and a professional steam cleaner, the stench mostly subsided. I can still smell a whiff of it on humid days.

#### Reflections: 
I can't believe it's been a year. This mystery will plague me until my last days on Earth.

#### The couch, in all of its non-stinked glory:
