I dye my clothes to customize colors, so why not shoes?! Someone on Reddit mentioned Angelus paints, so I ordered a few. I watched several YouTubes to make sure I got the technique right. I ordered a pair of Miz Mooz Leather Loafers from Poshmark for about $30 and they were a really hideous flesh color, but I loved the shape. I was really pleased with how they ended up!
