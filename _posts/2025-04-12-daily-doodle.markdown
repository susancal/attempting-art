#### Description: 
In 2006, I went to the Phantom Regiment Drum Major camp and they picked one lucky student to conduct the horn arn playing Canon in D. It was a girl with slender, average legs, and it's all you can see on the [video](https://youtu.be/vxlBHvOEcwc){:target="_blank"}. I thought it would be funny to imagine someone else conducting them with beefy badass legs instead.

#### Reflections: 
I wish I was that conductor!!!
