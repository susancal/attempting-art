## Hello, I'm S.O.B.!

Welcome to my journal! This site is my creative space where I document my personal journey, experiments, and inspirations. I'm not here to impress, just express. :) 

For a long time, "I'm not a creative person" was a thought in my head. I would actually say it out loud to people. I can play music, but I can't compose it. I can dance, but I can't choreograph. That's BULLSHIT! Creativity is so much more than making what most people think of as traditional art. I'm proving to myself that I _am_ creative in so many ways.


### About me
- I have an affinity for marching bands and am a uber-fan of Drum Corps International. I am on the [Bluecoats](https://bluecoats.com/){:target="_blank"} Board of Directors! I lost my mind during the marching band scene in Severance s2e10.
- I am an Illinois Certified Master Naturalist.
- I love people who are funny, kind, and don't take themselves too seriously.
- I can't do neutrals. My closet and home is full of vibrant and fun colors.
- I love horses... seriously it's just in my DNA
- I frequently experience [Frisson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson){:target="_blank"} when I listen to music. Music is the only stimulus to cause it for me!


### About This Site

I created this space to:
- Document my creative process and personal growth
- Build a visual diary of my art and other projects
- Share inspiration and ideas
- Have fun
- Show people you don't have to be good at something to enjoy and share it

#### Dedications
- Thanks to my best friend (shoutout to C.B.!), I have recently re-ignited my personal interest in making websites. 
- Thanks to my therapist (shoutout to a _different_ C.B.!!), I've decided that making and finding joy is a Very Important Goal of mine. This website is an artifact of that goal. 
- Thanks to Dev Bootcamp, I have been replaying "make beautiful and meaningful things" as a comforting thought in these weird times. To me, this website is both. I don't care if the code is crap.
- Thank you to my husband and family, who encourage me, tell me I'm wonderful, and accept me for being the sensitive and anxious person I am.
- Thank you to my sweet buddy boy Disco, who always tries his best and helps me become a more patient, kind, and understanding person. I strive to be the the person you think I am.

Feel free to explore, and I hope you find some inspiration for your own creative endeavors!
